# Touch_Bistro_Challenge


--> I have Production experiance in Node JS for around an year. Though I majorly worked on Spring Boot, My academic project and some prpfessional experiance 
helped me aquire good skill in Node.
--> I do not have production experiance in react till now. I have production experiance in Angular for 3 years. I have learnt react upon intrest 
during my university and I felt it easy to adopt since I have experiance in Angular.
